			<div id="explanation">
				<p>A number can be entered in the first text field in order to change the preset of the shape. By preset, I mean
				you can change the graph to whatever regular polygon you wish to start with.</p>
				<p>The second line of text fields can be used to create a new node starting with a degree of zero at the x and y coordinates you provide. Displayed
				directly below the canvas space are the x and y coordinates of your mouse when it enters the canvas. Use these numbers to determine where you would like to 
				place your new node. The canvas size is 500px by 500px so please keep the values you enter between 0  and 500.</p>
				<p>The third line of text fields can be used to create an edge between the two nodes you enter. Use the numbers displayed at the top right of each node
				in order to reference the nodes you wish to connect.</p>
				<p>The final information below the canvas displays the degree of each node. Each position in the array enclosed in brackets
				corresponds directly and sequentially to a node on the canvas. For instance, the first number corresponds to the degree of node 0. Using all these pieces of information
				you have all you need to determine if two graphs are isomorphic. For example, if you start out with a preset regular polygon you can move the nodes around in any way you 
				wish but as long as you don't add edges or nodes, you will always have a graph isomorphic to the original preset polygon. Enjoy!
				<p>Update: Added a Create Image button than will open up a 500px by 500px image of the current canvas in a new browser tab. Simple right click the image and select
				"Save Image As..." in order to save what you have created onto your computer or laptop.</p>
				<p>I plan to use this tool to create unique isomorphic graphs. I will then use these pictures for a website that will test how quickly the human eye can detect whether
				two graphs are isomorphic or not. Please feel free to email me with any questions or ideas concerning this tool at deliaevan1@gmail.com</p>
